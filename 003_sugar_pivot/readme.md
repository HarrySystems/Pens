# Sugar Pivot
Prototype of a pivot core based on sugar.js functions.

The idea is to reproduce Dharma.js core with minimal work, trying to use sugar.js functions and extending it with more aggregators.

This core should only give the tools to calculate data, not the rendering process itself (which should be a plugin anyway)

## Core functionality
- Filter
- Group (multiple views)
- Details (drilldown)
- Aggregate
- Order
- Aggregate (summarize values by)
- View (view values as)

## Usability
- Everything should be ovewritable via functions
- There should be minimal API configuration
